# Question 2: UDP Chat application


Create a UDP chat application for communicating with your phone using
the UDP monitor
 - Install the UDP monitor application on your android phone. Connect
your phone and PC such that they are on the same network. This can
be done either by
   1. Connecting them to the same wifi network
   2. Connecting your PC to phoneâ€™s mobile hot-spot, or
   3. Connecting phone and PC via USB tethering

 - Once you ensure phone and PC are on the same network, open the
UDP monitor application on the phone.
 - The IPv4 address of your phone will be displayed on the top left corner.
Also select the local port on the phone. Use this address while designing
your UDP chat application.
 - For two way communication give the remote address and port of your
PC in the UDP monitor mobile application.
